  "pages.mainPage.settings.descriptionText.description": "The Pool Control SmartApp (v0.3) is for people who have a pool with a two speed pump/filter system. This App can work in combination with other automations. In fact, it assumes you will use other Apps to do things like turn the pump on and off each day for a short period of time to keep the water cleen.  It is for this very reason that this App remembers the setting of the pump, and if another automation changes the pump setting while it is above the freeze setting, this SmartApp will not overide the changes initiated elsewhere. This makes this App's operation very compatible with other Apps and very intelligent.",
